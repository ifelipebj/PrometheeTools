* This is a new release.

### Package summary 

* This package provides sorting tools based on PROMETHEE, which have been 
  published in highly impactful indexed journals. 

* The suggested functions can be used with a large number of alternatives, 
  overcoming the limitations of the existing PROMETHEEI and II packages found in 
  CRAN. This enhancement extends its utility to address practical challenges.
