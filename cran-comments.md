* This is a new release.

### Package summary 

* This package includes PROMETHEE to handle a large number of alternatives, GLNF
sorting algorithm to classify alternatives into ordered categories and SILS function to
measure the classification quality, which has been published in a high-impact journal. 

* The developed functions can handle a large number of alternatives, overcoming the
limitations of the existing PROMETHEEI and II packages found in CRAN. This proposal
allows dealing with new and difficult challenges in multicriteria decision making.
